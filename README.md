# ai_voice_app

I have developed an app with features that include text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and speech-translate-to-English functionalities, all built using the OpenAI API.

I published the repository a month after building the app and realized that I had made several mistakes, such as creating instances of a class everywhere, not adhering to a clean architecture, neglecting clean and readable code, and not ensuring maintainable code. That's why I won't be fixing these mistakes in this project.
